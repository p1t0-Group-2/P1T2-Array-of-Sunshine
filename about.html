        <p>
          Jonathan has a demonstrated history of using his computer programming
          skills and logic to implement automation in business processes and
          reporting and develop forms and applications for use in financial,
          supply chain, operations, customer service, and commercial functions.

          programming languages with an aim to deploy stable web applications
