        <h3>Jonathan</h3>
        <p>
          Jonathan has a demonstrated history of using his computer programming
          skills and logic to implement automation in business processes and
          reporting and develop forms and applications for use in financial,
          supply chain, operations, customer service, and commercial functions.
          However, much of that programming has been done with Visual Basic/VBA
          in the Microsoft Office Suite. Jonathan began the Columbia University
          Computer Programming Bootcamp in an effort to learn new, practical
          programming languages with an aim to deploy stable web applications
          designed to help businesses achieve their goals with bespoke
          programming written for their needs. You can contact Jonathan using
